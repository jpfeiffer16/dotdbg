# Dotdbg dotnet debugger frontend for vim

dotdbg uses the Samsung dotnet debugger to provide a dotnet core debugging experience for vim.

NOTE:
Microsoft clearly states in their EULA for the vsdbg debugger it is NOT to be used outside of Microsoft products. So if you choose of your own free will to enable it with the USE_MICROSTOFT_DEBUGGER flag, I am not responsible for anything.
